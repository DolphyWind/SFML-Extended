+ Numeric/Math
++ Slerp
++ And many more

+ Managers/AudioManager
+ Managers/TextureManager (Name could change)
+ Graphics/Squircle

# Ideas might get implemented
+ Numeric/Matrix -> Requires Numeric/VectorN<T> to be implemented (N dimentional vectors)
+ Numeric/Quaternion -> I have to learn how quaternions represent 3d rotations.
+ Numeric/Math/Slerp -> Requires quaternions to be implemented

# Ideas probably won't be implemented
+ Numeric/Random -> There are a lot of random libraries already written for c++
